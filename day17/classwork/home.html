    <p>While lamb and veal barbecue is more popular elsewhere, pork barbecue is considered the most popular in Georgia, especially from Georgian-bred pigs. Barbecue methods vary — it can be grilled on metal or wooden skewers, in a pan, in the oven, or on a grill.

A special phenomenon in Georgian gastronomic culture is the Kakhetian barbecue. The meat for the barbecue must be of the Kakhetian breed of pork, and the charcoal on which it is grilled is made of tsalmi (a vine branch) or deki (a shrubby plant), which gives the meat grilled in this way a unique taste and tenderness, especially when it is seasoned with Kakhetian qvevri wine or pomegranate juice.

They put the “cured” meat pieces cut into “luks” on a spit and turn it over the coals, covered with salt. A good barbecue should have a “tsveti” (saba), a “mtsveti” (gud. mt.), a “mtsvari” (ertso), (hence: “tsvriyani mtsvadi” — the drippings of fat that drip from the barbecue during grilling). They bring it to the table on a spit and put it in jars by hand. They also know how to grill it in ash. This simple way of grilling meat is common to the human race, and perhaps that is why almost all nations consider barbecue to be their national dish. They know how to grill game meat on the spot, on a spit, or they will make a skewer out of a “deka” leaf, make a skewer from the deka bark and grill it. The Kakheti also grill it over the coals of tsalmi. [ 1 ]</p>
